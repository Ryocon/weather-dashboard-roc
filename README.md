# weather-dashboard-roc

## Description
This project is a weather dashboard that pulls data from the Openweather API. The app displays the current weather, an icon showing the weather, temperature in celcius, wind speed, humidity and UV Index. It also displays the next 5 days weather forecast and can allow the user to search their most recent search.

## Technologies Used 
This app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness. Moment JS and Fontawesome were in earlier verisons of the porject but have been removed from deployment as they became redundant.

## Future Developments
In the future I would like to alter the styling using Bootstraps grid system rather than flex as it would stretch my learning of the library further. I would also like the appended search buttons to have full functionality and be able to search the location saved in the innerText as opposed just the immediate previous search button.
